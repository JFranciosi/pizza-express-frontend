                <h2>5. Fair Play & Game Algorithm</h2>
                <p>
                    Pizza Express utilizes a <strong>Provably Fair</strong> system to guarantee transparency and
                    fairness.
                    The outcome of each game round is pre-determined using a cryptographic hashing algorithm (SHA-256)
                    and cannot be altered once the round has started.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">
                    <strong>How it works:</strong><br>
                    The crash point is generated by combining a Server Seed (kept secret initially) and a Client Seed
                    (typically a hash of a block or public input).
                    This generates a result that is completely random and verifiable.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">
                    <strong>Winning Probabilities:</strong><br>
                    The theoretical Return to Player (RTP) is approximately 99%. The remaining 1% represents the "House
                    Edge," ensuring the sustainability of the platform.
